# 🚍 Smart Campus Bus Scheduler

Welcome to the **Smart Campus Bus Scheduler**, an intelligent and responsive system designed to optimize campus transportation for **University X**—a large academic institution with over **20,000 students and staff**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

University X currently operates a fixed-route, fixed-schedule campus bus service. However, this traditional model faces several critical issues:

- 🔴 **Overcrowding during peak hours**, leaving students behind
- ⚪ **Empty buses during off-peak hours**, leading to resource waste
- ⚠️ **Inability to reroute** in case of traffic congestion or breakdowns
- 🕒 **Unreliable arrival times**, causing student and staff delays

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

This project introduces a **Smart Bus Scheduling System** that adapts in real-time using **live data** and **intelligent algorithms** to:

- Dynamically adjust routes and schedules based on demand and traffic
- Reduce inefficiencies and enhance commuter satisfaction
- Enable proactive communication about delays or disruptions

---
