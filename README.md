🚍 Smart Campus Bus Scheduler
Welcome to the Smart Campus Bus Scheduler – an intelligent and responsive system designed to improve the efficiency of campus bus operations at University X, a large academic institution with over 20,000 students and staff.

🧭 Project Overview
The current bus service at University X operates on fixed routes and static schedules, which has led to a number of challenges:

🚶‍♂️ Overcrowding during peak hours, often leaving students behind

🚌 Empty buses running during off-peak periods, wasting resources

❌ Inflexible routes unable to respond to traffic jams or bus breakdowns

⌛ Unpredictable arrival times, resulting in delays and dissatisfaction

To address these issues, we propose a Smart Bus Scheduling System that leverages real-time data, dynamic algorithms, and smart routing to enhance the reliability and efficiency of campus transport.

🌟 Key Features
Live Data Integration
Real-time GPS tracking of buses and sensors at bus stops for demand estimation.

Dynamic Route Adjustment
Routes and schedules adjust automatically based on traffic conditions and student demand.

Peak Hour Load Balancing
Intelligent algorithms distribute capacity efficiently to reduce overcrowding.

Smart Alerts
Notify users of delays, reroutes, or changes in schedule.

Interactive Web Dashboard
Visualize bus movements, predicted arrival times, and usage analytics.

📈 Benefits
✅ Reduces wait time and missed rides

✅ Minimizes fuel and resource waste

✅ Improves student and staff satisfaction

✅ Enables scalable, real-time operations management

🛠️ Tech Stack
Backend: Spring Boot (Java), RESTful APIs

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Leaflet.js (for maps)

Database: MongoDB
